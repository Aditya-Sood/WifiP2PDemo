- Change own device name
- Improve Spinner drop down view
- Figure how broadcast receiver works
- Visual peer selection process

* Working:
- So the broadcast receiver detects new devices on its own once registered, no need to repeat the procedure.
- Also, identifies peers that have left on its own as well (in about a minute)
- However, the devices only look for peers for a short duration of time - When both are mutually searching for devices (assuming to be roughly about a minute). So ensure that both are searching for that duration.
